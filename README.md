Download the dataset from Kaggle and add this data under a folder named 'input'

This repository consists of three notebooks:
  1) spacy-text.ipynb, which is used mainly. This notebook consists of the implementation of the naive model, spacy model and graph implementation
  2) spacy-ngram.ipynb, which is almost similar to spacy-text, except it uses ngram as an extra way of predicting the labels
  3) generate-ngram.ipynb, which is the notebook that was used to generate the ngram contexts for spacy-ngram
